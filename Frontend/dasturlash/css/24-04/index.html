    <h4>TEXT DETAILS</h4>
    <p>‘Honoured sir,’ he began almost with solemnity, ‘poverty 
        is not a vice, that’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunk￾enness is not a virtue, and that that’s even truer. But beggary, 
        honoured sir, beggary is a vice. In poverty you may still re￾tain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary—never—no 
        one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human society 
        with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it 
        as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch 
        as in beggary I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. 
        Hence the pot-house! Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Le￾beziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very 
        different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me to 
        ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you 
        ever spent a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?’
        ‘No, I have not happened to,’ answered Raskolnikov. 
        ‘What do you mean?’
        ‘Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve 
        slept so….’ He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of 
        hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his 
        hair. It seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or 
        washed for the last five days. His hands, particularly, were 
        filthy. They were fat and red, with black nails.
        His conversation seemed to excite a general though lan￾guid interest. The boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The 
        innkeeper came down from the upper room, apparently on 
        purpose to listen to the ‘funny fellow’ and sat down at a 
        little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity. Evidently 
        Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most

        likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from 
        the habit of frequently entering into conversation with 
        strangers of all sorts in the tavern. This habit develops into 
        a necessity in some drunkards, and especially in those who 
        are looked after sharply and kept in order at home. Hence 
        in the company of other drinkers they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.
        ‘Funny fellow!’ pronounced the innkeeper. ‘And why 
        don’t you work, why aren’t you at your duty, if you are in 
        the service?’
        ‘Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,’ Marmeladov 
        went on, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as 
        though it had been he who put that question to him. ‘Why 
        am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache to think what 
        a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov 
        beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I 
        suffer? Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you 
        … hm … well, to petition hopelessly for a loan?’
        ‘Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?’
        ‘Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, 
        beforehand with positive certainty that this man, this most 
        reputable and exemplary citizen, will on no consideration 
        give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he? For 
        he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compassion? But Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern 
        ideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden 
        nowadays by science itself, and that that’s what is done now 
        in England, where there is political economy. Why, I ask</p>
