            <p> The use of processed or prepared meals or agricultural products has increased in recent years due to
                advances in food processing technologies, which therefore have a great impact on our daily lives.
                This effect is mostly positive as cooked foods improve quality of life, although some caveats may
                need to be taken into account when evaluating that effect.
                Perhaps the most obvious result of easy cooking is that more and more food is available and ready te
                eat. As a result, it becomes easier to get food, therefore, people have more time for other things.
                As we get busier and have less time to cook, processed foods can help us avoid some boring
                activities like cutting or peeling vegetables or meat, making cooking more enjoyable. For example,
                instead of spending 30 minutes cutting, peeling, and seasoning chicken ribs, some can buy a
                ready-to-eat package of BBQ ribs of almost the same quality. Also, sometimes cooked meals are
                cheaper and easier to deliver.
